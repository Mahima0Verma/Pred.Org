          <h3>Asking for money</h3>
          <p>
            If an employer asks you for money in the form of training fee,
            application/admission fee, security deposit, test fee, laptop fee,
            documentation fee, interview reservation fee, etc., please do not
            make any payment and report him/her immediatety. Charging money is
            not only a violation of Internshala's rules, it is often a scam.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Discrepancy in job description</h3>
          <p>
            An employer could offer you a different job than what you had
            applied for on Internshala. If the job offered involves any of the
            following, please report it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consuming alcohol or smoking or inducing others to do so</li>
            <li>
              Promoting explicit religious content, a particular religious
              personality, or a sect, etc
            </li>
            <li>Gambling or related games</li>
            <li>
              Network-level marketing - where your only role is to promote or
              sell a product or service to your friends and family
            </li>
            <li>Watching or creating content for adult websites</li>
            <li>
              Undertaking paid courses, workshops or training programmes as part
              of the internship/job
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Refusal to pay stipend/salary or issue certificate</h3>
          <p>
            On Internshala, jobs with CTC less than 2 LPA and unpaid internships
            are not allowed, unless explicitly mentioned so in the
            internship/job listing. If you come across any such incident where
            the stipend/salary mentioned on Internshala and the offer letter do
            not match, do notify us.<br />
            There also might be a case where the employer might stop responding
            to you or refuse to pay you the promised salary/stipend or issue the
            certificate of completion, after you have performed the assigned
            work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Asking for irrelevant assignments</h3>
          <p>
            Any assignment that an employer asks you to do should assess your
            suitability for the role, and should be relevant to the profile.<br />
            Please report employers, if they asks you to do extremely lengthy
            assignments which may involve making business strategies for their
            company, writing multiple articles for their blog, promoting their
            social media accounts in your network, increasing downloads of their
            app, or designing multiple graphics for their company. These
            assignments may be a scheme by the company to get free work done.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Asking for personal and bank details</h3>
          <p>
            Be cautious of employers who ask for details like PIN, pan card,
            bank account, credit card, OTP, Aadhar, etc., via online channels,
            in exchange for a ‘special offer’. This may be a scammer trying to
            obtain your information to impersonate you.<br />
            Legitimate employers would have had sufficient interaction with you
            through interviews and would have expressed interest in hiring you,
            before requesting personal information like bank account details,
            pan card and marksheets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Hateful or abusive conduct</h3>
          <p>
            Employers are not allowed to make discriminatory or abusive comments
            about race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation or
            gender about any candidate. Any such attempt should be reported
            immediately.

        <div>
          To avoid discrepancies, we recommend that once you’re hired, you
          should request the employer for an offer letter clearly detailing all
          the important details such as roles & responsibilities, remuneration,
          payment mechanism, address and contact details of the employer.
